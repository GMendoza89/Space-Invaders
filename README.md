This is a C++ game that has been developed based on the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The game is designed to provide an immersive and exciting gaming experience, similar to the original game.

The objective of the game is to control a spaceship and defend it against an alien invasion. The player must move the spaceship left and right, firing bullets to destroy the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. The game features various levels of increasing difficulty, with new types of aliens and obstacles appearing as the player progresses.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In order to run the game, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A C++ compiler</li>
  <li>The SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework installed</li>
</ul>
<p>SFML is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a simple interface to various multimedia components, such as graphics, audio, and input devices, making it an ideal choice for game development.</p>
<p>If you don't already have a C++ compiler installed on your system, you can download one for free, such as <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/">MinGW-w64</a> (for Windows) or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> (for macOS).</p>
<p>To download the SFML library, you can visit the official website at <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">https://www.sfml-dev.org/</a> and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system and development environment.</p>
