Space Invaders Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Space Invaders game using SFML graphics library. The game consists of defending the planet Earth from alien invaders who come in waves.

Game Rules

The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, moving left and right to avoid incoming alien bullets and to shoot the aliens.
The aliens move left and right across the screen, gradually moving down one row after each pass.
The game ends if an alien collides with the player's spaceship or if the player's bullets eliminate all the aliens.
The game has several levels, and each level has more aliens than the previous one.
